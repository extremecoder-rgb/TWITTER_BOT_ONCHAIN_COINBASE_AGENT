## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered agent that operates on the Base blockchain and interacts with users through Twitter. Leveraging Coinbase's CDP Agentkit, the agent can perform various blockchain operations, engage in autonomous social interactions, and respond to Twitter mentions. The integration with Gemini 1.5 Flash provides advanced language capabilities, making the agent both smart and engaging.

## What I'm Proud Of
- Seamless integration of blockchain operations with social media automation.
- Use of cutting-edge AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for natural, engaging interactions.
- Autonomous and reactive modes for both proactive and responsive engagement.
- Secure handling of credentials and wallet data.
- Modular, extensible codebase that can be adapted for other networks or social platforms.
